What is Flash?
Flash was a multimedia platform used to create:

-Animations
-Web games
-Interactive websites
-Video players
-Advertisements

Originally developed by Macromedia and later acquired by Adobe, Flash content was played using the Adobe Flash Player browser plugin.

"Flash was a tool that let you make cartoons, games, and moving designs for websites. These were played using a plugin called Flash Player, like how you need a video player to watch videos."
