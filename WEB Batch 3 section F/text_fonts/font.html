<!-- A typeface is the design or style of a set of characters, including letters, numbers, and symbols. It defines how the characters look in terms of shape, weight, size, and other visual elements. A typeface is essentially a collection of fonts that share the same design.

Key Characteristics of a Typeface:
Design Identity: A typeface is the overarching artistic design or look of the text.
Includes Multiple Fonts: Each typeface can have different fonts, which vary by weight (e.g., bold), style (e.g., italic), and size.
Example: "Arial" is a typeface, while "Arial Bold 12pt" is a specific font.
Example of Typeface and Fonts:
Typeface: Times New Roman
Fonts within the Typeface:
Times New Roman Regular
Times New Roman Bold
Times New Roman Italic
Times New Roman Bold Italic
Typeface vs. Font
Typeface: Refers to the overall design of text characters.
Font: Refers to a specific implementation of a typeface in a particular weight, style, or size.
Think of a typeface as a "family" of related styles, and each font is a "member" of that family. -->
<!-- 
1. px (Pixels)
Definition: A fixed, absolute unit of measurement based on screen resolution. One px represents one dot on the screen.

Behavior: Does not scale relative to other elements or the root font size.

Use Case: Best for precise, fixed measurements where scalability is not required. -->


<!-- 2. em
Definition: A relative unit that is based on the font size of the parent element.

Behavior: Multiplies its value based on the parent's font size.

Use Case: Useful for elements that should scale relative to their immediate parent. -->

<!-- 3. rem (Root Em)
Definition: A relative unit that is based on the font size of the root element (<html>).

Behavior: Scales uniformly across the entire document regardless of nesting.

Use Case: Preferred for scalable and consistent designs -->









Types of Attribute Selectors
[attr] — Attribute Presence Selector

Selects elements that have the specified attribute, regardless of its value.
Example:

css
Copy code
[title] {
    color: blue;
}
html
Copy code
<div title="hello">This text will be blue.</div>
<div>This text won't be blue.</div>
[attr=value] — Exact Match Selector

Selects elements with an attribute that exactly matches the given value.
Example:

css
Copy code
[type="button"] {
    background-color: yellow;
}
html
Copy code
<input type="button" value="Click me"> <!-- Yellow background -->
<input type="text" value="Enter text"> <!-- Not styled -->
[attr~=value] — Word Match Selector

Selects elements with an attribute containing a word that matches the value, separated by spaces.
Example:

css
Copy code
[class~="featured"] {
    border: 2px solid green;
}
html
Copy code
<div class="box featured">Styled box</div> <!-- Matches -->
<div class="box not-featured">Not styled</div> <!-- Doesn't match -->
[attr|=value] — Prefix Match Selector

Matches elements with an attribute value that is exactly the given value or starts with the value followed by a -.
Example:

css
Copy code
[lang|="en"] {
    font-style: italic;
}
html
Copy code
<p lang="en">This will be italic.</p> <!-- Matches -->
<p lang="en-us">This will also be italic.</p> <!-- Matches -->
<p lang="fr">This will not be italic.</p> <!-- Doesn't match -->
[attr^=value] — Starts With Selector

Selects elements with an attribute value that begins with the specified value.
Example:

css
Copy code
[href^="https"] {
    color: green;
}
html
Copy code
<a href="https://example.com">Secure Link</a> <!-- Matches -->
<a href="http://example.com">Non-Secure Link</a> <!-- Doesn't match -->
[attr$=value] — Ends With Selector

Selects elements with an attribute value that ends with the specified value.
Example:

css
Copy code
[src$=".png"] {
    border: 1px solid red;
}
html
Copy code
<img src="image.png"> <!-- Matches -->
<img src="photo.jpg"> Doesn't match
